# ft_printf
The 3rd project of Starfleet.

Rules:
All exported functions need to be placed in their own file name, with helper functions within them being declared as static. Ex. https://github.com/linhvoyo/bistromatic/tree/master/bistromatic/srcs

To make the Github integration process easier, GitKraken can help quite a bit. 

Read open source code and try to mimic their methods of maintaining a high level of code readability and modularity. 

HOW TO RUN:
1. Go to the root directory.
2. make re; gcc -L. -lftprintf *.c; ./a.out; rm a.out
