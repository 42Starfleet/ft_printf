# ft_printf
The 3rd project of Starfleet.

Rules:
1. All exported functions need to be placed in their own file name, with helper functions within them being declared as static. Ex. https://github.com/linhvoyo/bistromatic/tree/master/bistromatic/srcs
2. For every function you create, comment: what is being returned, what parameters are taken, and what the function does.
3. Include in your README what your program does and your implementation methods(algorithm, data structures, ect). 
4. Norminette, refactor, and make your code readable before submitting a pull request. Ensure that you have a consistent naming scheme. 

Directory Structure:
1. Main directory folder. 
2. Unit tests folder. Follow the formatting provided in the file.
3. Misc. folder. Name it after your intra name (ttran, husui, brabo-hi, ect) and include your code if you wish for others to see it and possibly take from it. 

Tutorial:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone it and make the changes you wish.
3. Push said changes. 
4. Make a pull request.
5. If all rules are followed, the pull request will be accepted.

Team Board:
1. Questions can be asked here between members, useful links posted, and brainstorming can be done.

To make the Github integration process easier, GitKraken can help quite a bit. 

Read open source code and try to mimic their methods of maintaining a high level of code readability and modularity.
